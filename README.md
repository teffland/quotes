### Quotes

Quotes is a simple personal quote service. At least that's how I use it. But really its just a database that when you email it, your email is saved and then it randomly emails you subsamples of that database daily. Email personal.quote.service@gmail.com. A new email address automatically starts a new account. 

For example you send email like:

"It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment." -- Carl Friedrich Gauss

Then at 9am the next day, this quote will get bounced back to you.
